\section{Trapezoidal channel steady uniform flow case}
This scenario simulates steady, uniform flow in a trapezoidal channel. It tests the ability of the model to compute the correct flow depth, and the correct lateral distribution of flow velocity.

\subsection{Results}
Figure~\ref{downstream_depth} shows the along-channel depth and velocity (in the deepest part of the channel). Both should be nearly constant away from the boundaries, and agree with the analytical solution.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{xsect_vels} shows the cross-channel velocity profiles at a number of cross-sections. Ideally it should agree with the analytical solution, however, this may be difficult due to numerical diffusion in the cross-channel direction. Irrespective, the velocity profile should be qualitatively correct -- highest velocities should be in the channel centre, with lower velocities towards the banks.
